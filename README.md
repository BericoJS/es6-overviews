# es6-overviews

## To Run
* Install the latest iojs.  I suggest using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to manage toggling between node versions.
* Run files at command line: `node 2-reuse-error.js`

## Berico: to contribute new set of examples
* Make folder at root that corresponds to [babel transformer name](https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/transformers/).
* Add `1-`, `2-` style examples of es6 feature
* Review with team
* Add babel transformer name to `babel.options.whitelist` array in `mimosa-config` of projects and push.

## The world
* Have something to augment from tutorials we have been through?  Some edge case we didn't cover?  Submit a PR!
